# TOWNTUNER

Development Document for the Imbeciles

A Harmontown Sleep App for the Devoted

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**App Name:** TownTuner  
**Purpose:** A dedicated podcast player for all 360 episodes of Harmontown, designed specifically for nightly sleep listening with gamification elements  
**Platform:** iOS (Swift/SwiftUI)  
**Visual Style:** Brutalist monochrome - black, white, grays only. No colors. No gradients. No mercy.

---

## CORE MECHANICS

### The Prestige System
â€¢ Users start at Episode 1 and work through all 360 episodes chronologically  
â€¢ Completing all 360 episodes = 1 Prestige  
â€¢ Upon prestiging, all episodes reset to unplayed  
â€¢ Prestige counter displays permanently (e.g., "Prestige III, Episode 247/360")  
â€¢ Each prestige could unlock a new shade of gray for the UI (getting lighter each time until you eventually get white text on white background at Prestige 100)

### Episode Completion Rules
â€¢ An episode is marked "complete" when 85% has been played  
â€¢ Completed episodes drop to 0.5 opacity in the list  
â€¢ Completed episodes are removed from the shuffle pool  
â€¢ Progress persists through app closes

---

TOWNTUNER
Made with love and desperation

[VODKA BOTTLE CLICKER GAME]
Bottles clicked: 45,847

"Dan, just one show a year.
Please. We'll take anything.
Even a Zoom call."

Days since last episode: 2,047

Created by: [Credits]
Transcript API: [Credit to whoever]
Episode source: Your hard drive, apparently

[Tiny text]: This app is not affiliated with Harmontown, 
Dan Harmon, or anyone who could sue us
```

**Cookie Clicker Mechanics:**
â€¢ Tap vodka bottle, it spins and makes a "clink" sound  
â€¢ Counter increases  
â€¢ Every 100 clicks: Bottle briefly turns gold  
â€¢ Every 1000 clicks: Unlock new bottle design  
â€¢ Connects to Firebase to update global counter  
â€¢ No rewards, just numbers going up

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

â€¢ Episodes stored locally (user provides files)  
â€¢ Core Data or SQLite for:
  - Play history
  - Episode progress

  - Stats tracking
  - Guest metadata

### Audio Player
â€¢ AVFoundation for playbook  
â€¢ Background audio support (configure Info.plist)  
â€¢ Lock screen controls  
â€¢ AirPlay support

### File Structure Expected
```

```

### API Integrations
â€¢ Transcript search: [Existing embedding API endpoint]  
â€¢ Global vodka counter: Simple Firebase counter  
â€¢ No other external dependencies

---

## UI/UX PRINCIPLES

### 1. BRUTALIST AESTHETIC
â€¢ Black background  
â€¢ White text  
â€¢ System fonts only (SF Pro Display)  
â€¢ No rounded corners over 4pt radius  
â€¢ No animations over 0.2 seconds  
â€¢ No colors except grayscale

### 2. THUMB-FIRST DESIGN
â€¢ All primary actions reachable with right thumb  
â€¢ Minimum touch targets: 48x48pt  
â€¢ Shuffle button always accessible  
â€¢ Designed for half-asleep operation

### 3. INFORMATION HIERARCHY
â€¢ Episode number > Date > Comptroller  
â€¢ Prestige always visible but subtle  
â€¢ Playing state obvious (inverted colors)  
â€¢ Unplayed episodes prominent, played episodes ghost

---

## LAUNCH REQUIREMENTS

â€¢ Sleep detection - auto-pause if you wake up  
â€¢ Dan Harmon detection - sends notification if he mentions the app (he won't)

---

## FINAL NOTES FOR THE IMBECILES

â€¢ This is a labor of love, not money  
â€¢ No ads, no IAP, no bullshit  
â€¢ If Dan's lawyers contact us, immediately capitulate  
â€¢ The vodka bottle clicker is non-negotiable  
â€¢ Prestige system must feel meaningful but ultimately pointless  
â€¢ Every design decision should make someone who's barely conscious go "yeah that makes sense"  
â€¢ If you're adding a feature, ask yourself: "Would I use this at 2 AM with a cat on my chest?" If no, delete it
