TOWNTUNER

Development Document for the Imbeciles

A Harmontown Sleep App for the Devoted---PROJECT OVERVIEW
App Name: TownTuner
Purpose: A dedicated podcast player for all 360 episodes of Harmontown, designed specifically for nightly sleep listening with gamification elements
Platform: iOS (Swift/SwiftUI)
Visual Style: Brutalist monochrome - black, white, grays only. No colors. No gradients. No mercy.---CORE MECHANICS

The Prestige System
• Users start at Episode 1 and work through all 360 episodes chronologically
• Completing all 360 episodes = 1 Prestige
• Upon prestiging, all episodes reset to unplayed
• Prestige counter displays permanently (e.g., “Prestige III, Episode 247/360”)
• Each prestige could unlock a new shade of gray for the UI (getting lighter each time until you eventually get white text on white background at Prestige 100)
Episode Completion Rules
• An episode is marked “complete” when 85% has been played
• Completed episodes drop to 0.5 opacity in the list
• Completed episodes are removed from the shuffle pool
• Progress persists through app closes---SCREEN SPECIFICATIONS

Cookie Clicker Mechanics:

• Tap vodka bottle, it spins and makes a “clink” sound
• Counter increases
• Every 100 clicks: Bottle briefly turns gold
• Every 1000 clicks: Unlock new bottle design
• Connects to Firebase to update global counter
• No rewards, just numbers going up---TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Data Storage
• Episodes stored locally (user provides files)
• Core Data or SQLite for:
• Play history
• Episode progress
• Prestige count
• Stats tracking
• Guest metadata
Audio Player
• AVFoundation for playback
• Background audio support (configure Info.plist)
• Lock screen controls
• AirPlay support
• Remember playback position per episode

• No colors except grayscale
1. THUMB-FIRST DESIGN

• Transcript search integration
• Global vodka counter

Dream Features (Version 2.0)
• “Spencer Mode” - only episodes where Spencer DMs
• “Comptroller Mode” - Jeff episodes vs Spencer episodes
• Sleep detection - auto-pause if you wake up
• Dan Harmon detection - sends notification if he mentions the app (he won’t)---FINAL NOTES FOR THE IMBECILES
• This is a labor of love, not money
• No ads, no IAP, no bullshit
• If Dan’s lawyers contact us, immediately capitulate
• The vodka bottle clicker is non-negotiable
• Prestige system must feel meaningful but ultimately pointless
• Every design decision should make someone who’s barely conscious go “yeah that makes sense”
• If you’re adding a feature, ask yourself: “Would I use this at 2 AM with a cat on my chest?” If no, delete it---BUILD THIS EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED OR THE GHOST OF HARMONTOWN WILL HAUNT YOUR STANDUPS

End of document. Go forth and code, you beautiful imbeciles.
